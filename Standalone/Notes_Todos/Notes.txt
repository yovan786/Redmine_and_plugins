1. To install Redmine: http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/RedmineInstall

2. This book continually references a sample plugin known as the Redmine Knowledgebase plugin.
https://github.com/alexbevi/redmine_knowledgebase

3. Our knowledgebase is a plugin that offers a hybrid solution that lies somewhere between Redmine's wiki and
document functionality.
It allows us to create articles that can be stored within categories. Categories are stored in a hierarchical fashion, so a category "tree" can be presented to users on the knowledgebase landing page - images/2016-09-01_122332.png

We will create the knowledgebase plugin. But if we were  to install it go to the Github page.
